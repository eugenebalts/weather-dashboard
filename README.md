# Weather Dashboard

‚õÖ **`Weather Dashboard`** is a web application that provides current weather information and a 5-day weather forecast based on user-provided coordinates.

:rocket: **UI Deployment:** [``https://eugenebalts.github.io/weather-dashboard/build/``](https://eugenebalts.github.io/weather-dashboard/build/) 

## Checklist
